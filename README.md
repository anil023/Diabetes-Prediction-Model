# Diabetes Prediction Model
<!--Define Diabetes-->
Diabetes is a health condition that affects how your body manages sugar, also known as glucose. When you consume food, your body breaks it down into glucose, which serves as an energy source. To facilitate glucose entry into cells where it's needed, your body relies on a hormone called insulin. In diabetes, there's an issue related to insulin: either your body doesn't produce insulin at all, or it doesn't effectively utilize the insulin it produces, and in some cases, it may not produce enough.
<!--Define GDM-->
Pregnancy-induced diabetes, also known as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin to meet the increased demands brought on by pregnancy, resulting in elevated blood sugar levels. GDM typically arises in the second or third trimester and poses several risks to both the mother and the baby. Uncontrolled GDM can lead to high blood pressure, preeclampsia, birth injuries, the necessity of cesarean sections, or an increased risk of stillbirth. Women with GDM also have an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies are at risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), jaundice, and respiratory distress syndrome.
<!--Why Predictive Models-->
Pregnancy-induced diabetes presents significant risks, and thus, it requires careful management to ensure the health of both the mother and the baby. Managing GDM involves monitoring blood sugar levels, making dietary adjustments, and, in some cases, using insulin or other medications as prescribed by a healthcare provider. Predictive models can play a crucial role in identifying individuals at risk and providing personalized care to mitigate these risks, ultimately leading to healthier pregnancies and improved outcomes for both mothers and newborns.


## THE PROBLEM
<!--Objective-->
Data sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is accessible on Kaggle through the following [(link)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database "Kaggle Link to the Dataset"). This dataset pertains to females aged at least 21 years from the Pima Indian heritage. The primary objective of this repository is to employ machine learning models in the R language to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes. This prediction is based on the dataset's provided characteristic measurements. We will explore various classification models, both linear and nonlinear, suitable for binary classification and some appropriate for multiple-class classification, for the purpose of comparison.
<!--Evaluation Criteria-->
To evaluate the performance of these models, we will employ Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric. The AUC metric quantifies the degree of separability between classes and their distinguishability. Subsequently, the top two models selected from this training dataset comparison will undergo evaluation using the test set. The final choice of the best model will be based on the comparison of AUC metrics.

<!--Data Types-->
The raw dataset contains data from 768 patients, comprising 8 predictor variables and one response variable. In our model, the response variable of interest is labeled as Outcome. It is initially presented as a binary numerical variable but is later transformed into a categorical variable during our analysis. In this transformation, a value of 0 signifies the absence of diabetes, while a value of 1 indicates that the patient has diabetes. There are no categorical predictors and eight (8) continuous predictors:

Upon observing the scatterplot matrix, we notice a slight positive correlation between [Glucose and Insulin] and [SkinThickness and BMI]. We should investigate this further during the data pre-processing stage.

It's evident that most variables exhibit a skewed distribution in the histogram plot above. In the next step, we should assess the skewness values and, if necessary, proceed with data transformation to mitigate the skewness.

We can conclude that the majority of predictors have outliers in the data. To mitigate the impact of these outliers, we will standardize the data during the pre-processing stage.

## DATA PRE-PROCESSING/CLEANING/WRANGLING

In the dataset, there were no missing values; therefore, no imputation or deletion was required. Investigating predictors with zero or near-zero variance is a useful procedure to determine whether any predictor should be removed. Because all predictors in this dataset were continuous, there were no predictors with variances close to zero. Another technique to assess the need for predictor reduction is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). After applying PCA to the Pima Indian data, the results revealed that 8 components were required to explain 95% of the variance. For this reason, no predictors were removed.
